Yuer DSL
Expression-Driven Decision Language for Cognitive AI Systems
A deterministic, auditable, semantic-control language powering EDCA OS.

Overview

Yuer DSL is a next-generation, expression-driven decision language designed to control AI cognitive systems with deterministic, auditable, and structured behavior.

It is the primary language layer of EDCA-OS (Expression-Driven Cognitive Architecture), enabling:

deterministic task execution

semantic-layer control

stable reasoning chains

auditable cognitive behavior

conflict-free multi-step operations

Unlike prompt-based instructions, Yuer DSL defines explicit execution structures, control metadata, and behavioral contracts that guide the model safely and predictably.

Why a New AI Language?

Modern LLMs interpret natural language probabilistically.
This leads to:

unpredictable responses

prompt injection vulnerabilities

unstable multi-step behavior

hallucination under semantic pressure

no audit trail

Yuer DSL solves these problems by shifting from free-text instructions → structured expression protocols, providing:

✔ deterministic behavior
✔ safe execution boundaries
✔ clear control plane
✔ reasoning override frameworks
✔ audit-grade metadata

This makes Yuer DSL fundamentally different from any prompt engineering or scripting approach.

Language Philosophy

Yuer DSL is designed around three principles:

1. Expression Drives Execution

The language is not “natural language for humans”—
it is structured expression for AI cognition.

2. Metadata Controls Behavior

Every Yuer file embeds CONTROL + SIGNATURE blocks for:

stability

energy budgets

reasoning constraints

execution consistency

semantic hashing

3. Determinism Over Guesswork

The model must follow the structure, not interpret freely.

 Yuer DSL File Structure

A .yuer file is composed of structured blocks:

YUER v1.0
AUTHOR: yuer (Guanyu)
DATE: 2025-11-13

INTENT: ...
SCOPE: ...
ANCHOR: [...]
RULES: ...
OUTPUT: ...

CONTROL:
    energy_budget: 1.8
    stability_lambda: 0.9
    flow_enabled: false

SIGNATURE: semantic_hash_v1
HASH: <auto-generated-hash>
DECLARATION: >
  Official Yuer DSL Behavior Contract
This metadata transforms a free-flowing model into a deterministic executor.

🔧 Core Language Features
✓ CONTROL Block (Execution Governance)

Specifies cognitive constraints & behavioral safety envelopes.

✓ SIGNATURE Block (Identity & Integrity)

Ensures reproducibility and verifies authorship.

✓ ANCHOR Block (Semantic Anchoring)

Fixes reasoning focus to prevent drift.

✓ RULES Block (Behavioral Contracts)

Defines execution rules, guardrails, and override conditions.

✓ OUTPUT Block (Deterministic Results)

Forces the model to output in structured, predictable formats.

Example (Minimal)

YUER v1.0
INTENT: Summarize document with deterministic structure.
SCOPE: 3 levels
ANCHOR: ["core idea", "supporting points", "risk"]

RULES:
  - No external assumptions
  - No stylistic drift
  - Always use bullet format

CONTROL:
    energy_budget: 1.0
    stability_lambda: 0.95
    flow_enabled: false

SIGNATURE: semantic_hash_v1

Relationship with EDCA OS

Yuer DSL is the language layer of the EDCA ecosystem:

Layer	Description
EDCA-OS	Cognitive Operating Framework
Yuer DSL	Expression-Driven Language for deterministic execution
Yuer DSL SDK	Developer tools (coming next)

All EDCA modules (SROE, SBE, SRP, APS, EMC, GRS) understand and consume Yuer DSL structures.

Yuer DSL SDK (Preview)

The SDK will provide:

DSL → JSON structured task compiler

Runtime executor adapters

Signature generator

Syntax validator

EDCA OS integration

Repository link will be added upon release.
